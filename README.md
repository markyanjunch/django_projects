# SI 664 Database Application Design  
## Branches 
There are three branches in this repo:  
- main:  
  Intergrates everything from before-mid CRUD apps to classified ads website.  
  Replaced sqlite with mysql server as the backend database server.  
  Moved to local development.  
- pythonanywhere:  
  A classified ads website. To access the website: https://markyanjunch.pythonanywhere.com  
  People can view ads without logging in and if they log in, they can create their own ads. It uses a social login that allows logging in using github accounts.  
  Features include adding pictures, comments, favorites, and tags to the ads application, and search ads through title, contents or tags.
- before-mid (archived):  
  Contains a Poll application, CRUD apps including Autos, Cats, Stars and Gadgets
